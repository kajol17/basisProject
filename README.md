### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/kajol17/basisProject)

### ✨ [Demo](https://obscure-ravine-23233.herokuapp.com)

## Usage

```sh
Make sure you have these already installed into your system to run locally:
1) NPM
2) Node.js -(http://nodejs.org/)
3) Git

$ git clone https://github.com/kajol17/basisProject
$ cd basisProject
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Assumptions

```sh
1) Since no information about group is given, ignoring that.
2) Since no action regarding admin is giving, I have ignored that.
3) Not checking read permission as it is allowed to all i.e user has either odd or even phone number.
```

## Issues

```sh
I have used the free version of Heroku for deployment. It has following issues:
1) Sleeps after 30 mins of inactivity.
2) Uses and account-based pool of free dyno hours.
3) Custom Domains.
```
